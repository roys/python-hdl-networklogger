## HDL network logger
This is a Python script to log network traffic from the smart house system HDL-BUS Pro.

### Running the script
To run the script just type `python networklogger.py`.

By default it will listen for UDP packages on all available network interfaces on port 6000.

### Configuring the script
To configure the script you create a new file called `hdlconfig.py`. There's an example config file called `hdlconfig-example.py` you should use as basis for your config.
